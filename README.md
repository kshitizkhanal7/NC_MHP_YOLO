# YOLOv8 Object Detection Model for Manufactured Housing Units

This repository is created to share a YOLOv8 model finetuned to identify Manufactured Housing Units from high-resolution aerial imagery.

A custom training dataset of 3200 images representing both single wide MHUs and double wide MHUs was created and was used to fine-tune a YOLOv8 object detection model trained on the COCO dataset.

* The model file is named: mbl_12_null.pt
* The dataset of parcels with four or more MHUs created using this model can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16317704.

This model is a part of the study on identifying Manufactured Home Parks (MHPs) funded by The School of Data Science and Society at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill through a seed grant. The details on the article resulting from the study will be shared as soon as it is published. 

The model is shared using an MIT Licence.
